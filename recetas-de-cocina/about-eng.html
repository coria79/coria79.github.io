                    Cooking recipes for programmers is born out of the need to provide the information that I, as a developer, would have liked to have when I was taking my first steps in this world.<br>
                    <br>
                    The main idea is to have a reference place for all the details that need to be taken into account when developing with these technologies.<br>
                    <br>
                    There is an important skill to develop related to searching for information accurately and quickly. Even using the official channels of the available technologies, that is really difficult in the beginning. And that's why this site becomes important for those who are just starting out. Since a common situation is facing adverse scenarios and not finding the right information is often the first hurdle to overcome.<br>
                    <br>
                    Even with the support of the official documentation, it is often difficult and confusing to find the desired information or solution. That's why the recipes have been configured so that everything is accessible to everyone's understanding, whether they are beginners or advanced in development.<br>
                    <br>
                    For beginners, the information is presented as simply as possible. For advanced users, it will serve as a reference for situations that may be forgotten in some uncommon scenarios. The effort is focused on not leaving loose ends when following the recipes. Since more than once it will have happened that due to a very small detail, we get stuck in a situation because a detail that seemed obvious was omitted, causing a problem for not having that information at that moment.<br>
                    <br>
                    The audience that can make use of these recipes needs to be a user with solid knowledge in the basics of computing. As you progress with the recipes, you will be able to improve your skills in the development world. In this first stage, it will mainly deal with Django.<br>
                    <br>
                    The information presented here is open to everyone. All comments made with the spirit of improving the site and the information found in the recipes will be welcome. Suggestions for new topics for future recipes can also be made.<br>
