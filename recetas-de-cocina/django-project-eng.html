                            <br>
                            - Web browser.<br>
                            - Terminal.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Cooking Time:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Completed the recipe: "Django Framework on Ubuntu from Windows with virtual machines."<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Objective:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            The use of the Linux terminal is an almost essential tool for developers. Getting used to using the terminal will be a daily occurrence. Therefore, it is important to develop the habit from the beginning. A good practice would be to type the command directly rather than copy-pasting. This will help a lot in incorporating the use of the terminal and entering commands.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Instructions:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Open the terminal. Access the terminal by pressing "Ctrl + Alt + T" or searching for "Terminal" in the application menu.<br>
                            - Know the current folder using the "pwd" command.<br>
                            - It will show something similar to: /home/user, where "user" is the username configured during installation. In this case, we are in the home of the user.<br>
                            - Use the "ls" command to see the contents of the folder. In this case, you will see the contents of the "user" folder.<br>
                            - It will show something similar to: Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  snap  Templates  Videos<br>
                            - Create the main project folder inside the "Documents" folder.<br>
                            - Use the "cd Documents" command to enter this folder.<br>
                            - Create the main folder that will contain the different Django projects using the "mkdir projects_django" command.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Activate Virtual Environment:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Enter the newly created folder using "cd projects_django".<br>
                            - Use the virtual environment already installed "virtualenv".<br>
                            - Use the "virtualenv -p python3 env-my_project" command to create the virtual environment.<br>
                            - Use the "source env-my_project/bin/activate" command to activate the virtual environment.<br>
                            - You can confirm the activation of the virtual environment because the prompt will show: (env-my_project)<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Install Django:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Use the "pip install django" command to install Django.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Create Project:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Use the "django-admin startproject my_project" command to create the project.<br>
                            - Use the "ls" command to show the folders inside "projects_django". You should see the newly created project folder "my_proyect".<br>
                            - The output of the "ls" command should be: manage.py  my_project<br>
                            - Use the "cd my_project" command to enter this folder.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Create Application:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Use the "python manage.py startapp my_app" command to create the app.<br>
                            - One detail to keep in mind is that the app's name must be different from the project's name. If you try to create it with the same name, you will get an error.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Run Server:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            - Use the "cd .." command to go up one level of the folder.<br>
                            - Use the "python manage.py runserver" command to run the project.<br>
                            - Open the browser, enter the URL: http://localhost:8000 or its alternative http://127.0.0.1:8000<br>
                            - CONTROL + C (to end the server execution)<br>
                            <br>
                            The recipe for the basic installation of the Django Framework has been completed.<br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Final Comments:</b><br>
                            <br>
                            The use of the terminal can be done with the Linux terminal. But it can also be done with the terminal that comes built into the IDE itself. In this case, since it is the first project, we chose to use the Linux terminal. But most likely, the majority of usage will be within the IDE, although it depends on each developer's comfort level.<br>
                            <br>
                            The virtual environment was configured in a folder outside the Django project but with a name similar to the project. This is done to make it a bit more intuitive to recognize the virtual environment and the corresponding project. Since there may be different projects with different virtual environments, for example, a virtual environment that works with an earlier version of Python. This intuitively separates the folders.<br>
                            <br>
                            Opening the browser and entering: localhost:8000 is the way to verify that the Django installation is correct. You will see a generic welcome page from Django.<br>
                            <br>
                            Regarding the use of English. Since it is the language on which all programming languages are based and on which all documentation is done, this site will follow the rule that everything will be in English except what needs to be shown to the user, which will be in Spanish (or another language). That's why you see that even the folder names will be in English.<br>
